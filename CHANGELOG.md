  ([GHSA-gcmj-c9gg-9vh6](https://github.com/msiemens/one2html/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmj-c9gg-9vh6) /
  CVE-2026-22810).
- Log warnings instead of panicking on unsupported constructs in image,
  list, note tag, and rich text rendering.

  `.onetoc2` section entries
  ([GHSA-4j5m-wc25-pvh7](https://github.com/msiemens/onenote.rs/security/advisories/GHSA-4j5m-wc25-pvh7)),
  guards against transaction-log offset under-/overflow, and avoids panics
  on malformed ink data.
